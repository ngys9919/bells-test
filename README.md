# Project Guide
For the purpose of the portfolio project, a landing page is created for the following:

```json
{
1. "An educational school" : in our case "Educational School: BELLSTECH"
}
```

This project is about *SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme (SCTP)* at **BELLSTECH**. 

The application of this project caters to the needs of a specific target user group, the mid-career changers,
who are looking for information on SCTP Courses at BELLSTECH, a tech business unit of [Bells Institute of Higher Learning][1].

The website provides an one-stop entry point to the SCTP Courses available, namely:

***
1. *(SCTP) Cyber-Security*
2. *(SCTP) Data-Science*
3. *(SCTP) Full-Stack*
4. *(SCTP) Block-Chain*
***

It also explains the tech roles [^bignote] and its briefing on these domain areas[^1], with contents created using AI Tool [Microsoft Copilot][2].

The web development is done using [Visual Studio Code][3] with responsive design concepts that provide media query breakpoints based on the following screen sizes:

***Bootstrap Breakpoints***
    
| Device(s) | Description | Prefix | Screen Sizes |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| phones | Extra small | None | <576px |
| portrait tablets and large phones | Small | sm | ≥576px |
| landscape tablets | Medium | md | ≥768px |
| laptops/desktops | Large | lg | ≥992px |
| large laptops and desktops | Extra large | xl | ≥1200px |
| large tv screens | Extra extra large | xxl | ≥1400px, max:1580px |


This simple website has a Bells logo and navigational bar with Home, About and Contact Us links in the landing page.\
This provides an inner site navigation that allows the user to view the different pages in the site.\
It also uses navbar, carousel, container, cards, form, badge, button and radio buttons from CSS Bootstrap.
